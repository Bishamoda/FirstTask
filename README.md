#How to install this App

Clone this app on your computer (select the folder yourself) with comand:  
git clone https://github.com/Bishamoda/FirstTask.git

Open "CMD" in folder (which were chosen earlier). Write commands:  
cd Console_calc  
dotnet build  
dotnet run  

#How it works

1) The programm will show available operations and ask you to enter a number.
2) Available operations: addition (+), multiplication (*), subtraction(-), division(/), resets the result - c(ENG) and "exit" - exit the application.
3) Next you enter a number. Automatically, this number will seem as a result and further operations will be used this number.
For example: Enter the number 1. The result will be: 1. Then enter number 3, operation "+" and the result will be 4.
4) After that, if you enter the letter "с" in the operation, then the result will be reset and will be 0.
5) If the user writes instead of a letter or not an existing operation, the program will display an error message.
6) The program takes the numbers integer and floating point. Positive and negative.
